;; # The system & main function

;; This is where everything actually ties together and starts.
;; If you're interested in tweaking things at a system level, have a look at metasoarous/datspec


;; ## The default system

(defn new-system []
  (-> (component/system-map
        :remote     (sente/new-sente-remote)
        ;; This should eventually be optional/defaulted
        :dispatcher (dispatcher/new-strictly-ordered-dispatcher)
        :app        (component/using
                      ;; Should also be able to specify your own conn here, though one will be created for you
                      (dat.view/new-datview {:dat.view/main views/main})
                      [:remote :dispatcher])
        :reactor    (component/using
                      (reactor/new-simple-reactor)
                      [:remote :dispatcher :app])
        :datsync    (component/using
                      (dat.sync/new-datsync)
                      [:remote :dispatcher]))))


;; ## Customizing things

;; That's all fine and dandy, but supposing we want to customize things?
;; This is a more fleshed out example of the system components being strung together

;;     (defn new-system []
;;       (-> (component/system-map
;;             ;; Have to require dat.reactor.dispatchers for this:
;;             :dispatcher (dispatchers/new-strictly-ordered-dispatcher)
;;             :remote     (dat.sync/new-sente-remote)
;;             :reactor    (component/using (dat.sync/new-datsync-reactor) [:remote :dispatcher])
;;             :app        (component/using (dat.view/new-datview {:dat.view/main views/main} [:remote :reactor :dispatcher]))))

;; If we don't specify :dispatcher or :remote, they get plugged in automatically by the datsync reactor, and
;; get plugged into datview for use in its components as well.


;; ## Stripping things down

;; Oh... You're not using DatSync but still wanna use DatView?

;; No problem.
;; Just plug in your own reactor.
;; As long as it satsfies the reactor protocols, everything should just work.
;; As long as our abstractions aren't leaking for you...
;; (Tell us if they do...)

;; Here's a quick example of what some

;;     (defn new-system []
;;       (-> (component/system-map
;;             :reactor    (reactor/new-simple-reactor)
;;             :load-data  (component/using (your.ns/new-data-loader) [:reactor])
;;             :app        (component/using (dat.view/new-datview {:dat.view/main views/main} [:reactor :load-data]))))


;; ## Dev system

;; Note that you could also put your own dev system here, or a cards system, so that you can share the
;; important structure and swap in things like fighweel components, etc.


;; # Your apps main function

;; Just start the component!

;; This is sort of terrible, should really be handling this state in the function and doing the interactive
;; dev thing in a separate dev file. For now though...
